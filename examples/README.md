# Examples

We host a wide range of [Tutorials](https://github.com/Shark-NLP/OpenICL/tree/main/examples/tutorials) to elaborate the basic usage of OpenICL. 

We also have some [research projects](https://github.com/Shark-NLP/OpenICL/tree/main/examples/research_projects) that reproduce results in research papers using OpenICL. 

Please discuss in an [issue](https://github.com/Shark-NLP/OpenICL/issues) a feature you would 
like to implement in an example before submitting a PR; we welcome bug fixes, 
but since we want to keep the examples as simple as possible it's unlikely 
that we will merge a pull request adding more functionality at the cost of readability.
